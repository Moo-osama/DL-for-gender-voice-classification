# DL-for-gender-voice-classification
Numerous voice-recognition applications depend on the paralinguistic information contained in the speech of the human voice. Detecting the gender of the human voice is one of the most critical information for such applications, a task that contains several obstacles. In this repo, we propose a solution to the gender detection problem, employing the power and superiority of deep learning techniques particularly in classification tasks.
